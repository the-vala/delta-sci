			<h2 id="lab-design">Box construction</h2> 
			<h4 align="center"><b>General Conditions</b></h4>
			<p align="justify" style= "line-heigth: normal"> For the preparation of the device, 33 staples and 4 scaffolds were used. 33 oligonucleotides and 4 gBlocks (scaffolds) were purchased from <a href="http://www.uniparts.com.mx/" target="_blank"><b>Uniparts</b></a>. Various stocks with different concentrations were prepared. Three options for the construction of the device were designed, each procedure requires specific conditions of the staples and scaffolds.</p>
 
			<p align="left"><b>Folding reaction</b></p>
				<p align="justify" style= "line-heigth: normal">A folding reaction contains scaffolds, staples, water, buffer and salt ions (Magnesium Chloride, MgCl2, was used as a salt in these experiments). The components mix due to the changes in temperature allowing the staples and scaffolds to bind together. </p>
				<p align="justify" style= "line-heigth: normal">Due to the few available quantity of DNA, not all the desired reactions were performed.  A number of  folding reactions were executed varying the concentration of MgCl2 to find the optimum concentration for the design. A magnesium gradient that consisted of three different concentrations was performed. Those concentrations were 12 mM,  20 mM and 26 mM.</p>

				<p align="left"><b>Standard folding reaction</b></p>
				<p align="justify">A folding reaction was made with the scaffolds @1 nM and an excess of 50 staples.</p>
				<p align="justify"></p>

			<p align="center"><strong>Table 1.</strong> Standard Folding reaction used in the different experiments. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Thermocycler</b></p>
                <p align="justify" style= "line-heigth: normal">As our scaffolds are double-stranded, they must be denatured in order to only use the desired sequence. The temperatures used in the thermocycler to denature the DNA were the following: First 90°C for 15 minutes, then it was cooled down to 25°C in less than 1 minute, after that the mixture was incubated for 2 minutes, subsequently, the mixture was heated at a temperature of 63°C, and finally it was cooled down slowly to 4°C at a rate of 20min/°C.</p>
            <p align="left"><b>Gel</b></p>
                <p align="justify" style= "line-heigth: normal">Electrophoresis gels were performed under the following conditions: Agarose gel was prepared at 2%.  It was made with buffer TBE at 0.5X and MgCl2 at 11mM. A molecular marker (1kb Promega) was used to load the gel.,  as well the sample substance, that is the product of the folding reaction. 
 </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Microscope</b></p>
            
                 <p align="justify" style= "line-heigth: normal">In Air Scan. The sample (2 µL) was deposited onto a freshly cleaved mica surface and left to adsorb for 2 min. Then 50 µL of deionized H2O was added onto the mica and was blown away immediately by condensed air. The dry sample was then scanned in Nova Software in semicontact mode.</p>

			The IONPs were mixed with DI water and sonicated during several minutes. 25 mL of APTES diluted in water were added to the tube containing the IONPs <i>(Image 2)</i>. After that, the tube was shaken in vortex. The solution was incubated in a laboratory oven during 3 hours at a temperature of 134°C.

				These IONPs were added following this criteria: a mix of DNA and IONPs is made. 5 µL of each substance is poured into an Eppendorf tube and resuspended in order to mix them properly. It is important to mention that the IONPs were centrifuged to separate them by size; the supernatant was taken because this contained the smaller IONPs needed to the characteristics of the device. The mix made was incubated during several minutes at room temperature.

The AFM <i>(Image 3)</i> and TEM <i>(Image 4)</i> were used, as well as the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).  The following text describe what was made in each one of them.
				The AFM was used in order to characterize the device, the technique used was in air scan. 
				The TEM and FTIR were used to prove the functionalization of the device. TEM showed different images of the IONPs before and after the functionalization. As a second source to ascertain the fuctionalization of the IONPs the FTIR was used obtaining graphical representations of the coated and uncoated IONPs. In addition to the FTIR, the Zeta Potential was measured with a Zeta Sizer.</p>
