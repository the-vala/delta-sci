				<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal"><i>Image 2</i> was obtained from the UCSF Chimera viewer, using a pdb file obtained from CanDo. The same structure as before is appreciated, but here the double helixes that conform the device are visualized, as well as the way they intersect each other.</p>

                <p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">Notice that, in both softwares, the device seems to lack of the single strands that should overhang from its base. This is because CanDo omits such sequences due to them being single stranded. UCSF Chimera does this too, considering the pdb file used was extracted from CanDo.</p>

			<h3 id="project-background">AFM results</h3> 
			<h5>Remember you can see the code in the <a href="labwork.html">Lab Work Section</a></h5>

			<h6>Folding Reactions #1 - #5</h6>
			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">It was decided to, first, test the third option from the different construction protocols. That is, making one single folding reaction where all scaffolds and staples were included. Despite having several folding reactions <i>(reactions #1 to #5)</i>, each one with a different concentration of magnesium chloride, none of them showed what we expected. Instead, different forms not located in our expected range of results and agglomerates, as those seen in <i>Image 3</i>, were seen.</p>

			<img style="height: 70%; width: 70%" src="img/dnafeoambos.png" id="2">
			<p align="center"><b>Image 3.</b> Micrographs in AFM of folding reaction <i>#1</i> (45-12-10).</p>

			<h6>Folding Reaction #6 (58-26-50)</h6>

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal" id="3">Consequently, a different approach was taken and the same folding reaction was used, but with an excess of fifty staples per scaffold. Another important fact was that this reaction (reaction #6) went through a different and longer process inside the thermocycler. <i>Image 4</i> presents the results  of two outstanding small structures (structures A and B) that are within our expected range of results.</p>

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">In order to analyze these micrographs, a software called SPIP was used. This software allowed us to set profiles with the purpose of measuring the different particles that we believe are part of our device. A close-up on structure A can be seen in <i>Image 4</i>, where two profiles (shown in blue and red) were placed to measure the structures.</p>

			<a href="img/dnabonito1.png" target="_blank">
			<img style="height: 500%; width: 500%" src="img/dnabonito1.png">
			</a>
			<p align="center"><b>Image 4.</b> Close-up of structure A with profile 1A (blue) and profile 2A (red).</p>

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">These two profiles, named Profile A1 and Profile A2, were compared in order to look for similar measures, this is shown in <i>Graph 1</i>. It is remarkable how both show similar patterns in similar points, which tells us that the figure tends to have a regular shape. Thus, meaning that there is a high possibility this is in fact our device. The assymetric depression can be explained by a range of error in the readings of the AFM (because of disturbances, problems with the machine itself, or both), or the design of the device, like in the <i> Self-assembly of a nanoscale DNA box with a controllable lid, </i>(Andersen et al., 2009).</p>

			</a>
			<p align="center"><b>Graph 1.</b> Overlapping of profile A1 (blue) and profile A2 (red).</p>

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">After analyzing Structure A, our attention was redirected to Structure B because of the obvious similarities in size. A close-up <i>(Image 5)</i> helped us to delimitate the edges of our device in order to use two new profiles to analyze and measure <i>(Graph 2)</i>. Notice how, despite having a distorted structure, graphs 1 and 2 show a site where hollowness can be observed.</p>

			<h6>Folding Reaction #7 (63-26-50)</h6> 
			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">This reaction <i>(Image 6)</i> showed many structures. Despite most of them having a similar size and structure, none of them seemed to be hollow. Therefore, we can't be really sure if those are in fact our device.</p>

			</a>
			<p align="center"><b>Image 6.</b> Micrograph in AFM of reaction #7</p>

			<h6 id="project-background">Folding reaction #10 (68-26-50)</h6> 

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">This is, what we think, the folding reaction with the best results yet. <i>Image 7</i> shows up close a sample that had an adsorption time of 2 minutes onto the mica.</p>

			<img style="height: 55%; width: 55%" src="img/dna681.png">
			<p align="center"><b>Image 7.</b> Micrograph in AFM of reaction #10 with 2 min of adsorption.</p>

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">Since the sample in <i>Image 7</i> seemed to be highly concentrated, another sample was prepared with an adsorption time of only 1 minute. This last sample <i>(Image 8)</i> appears to be cleaner and various structures that resemble our device can be seen.</p>

			<img style="height: 55%; width: 55%" src="img/dna682.png">
			<p align="center"><b>Image 8.</b> Micrograph in AFM of reaction #10 with 1min of adsorption.</p>

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">The size of several "cubes" were measured just as before by placing profiles over them and using SPIP. <i>Graph 3</i> shows a compilation of some of those. They show not only similarities in size and structure, but also a hollow site. That's great!</p>

			<p align="justify" style="line-height: normal">It is not difficult to notice that the experimentally measured device sizes do not exactly match the stipulated in the computational model. Nevertheless, it is important to remark the wide amount of parameters influencing the system. At this scale, both the width of the AFM cantilever’s tip (~10 nm) and the cations (from the MgCl2) attached to the DNA phosphate group increase the uncertainty of our measurements.</p>
